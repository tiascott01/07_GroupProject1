Working with Your Group
    - When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class.

    - Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you 
    begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the 
    group knows each group member’s available working hours.

    - Set up an agile project by using GitHub ProjectsLinks to an external site.

    - Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates 
    for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. 
    Some of these milestones might include:
        - Project ideation
        - Data fetching/API integration
        - Data analysis
        - Testing
        - Creating documentation
        - Creating the presentation
